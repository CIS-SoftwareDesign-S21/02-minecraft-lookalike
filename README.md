# Project Overview
[Terasology](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology) is a free and open-source survival game similar to Minecraft. We want to aid the development of one of the Terasology organization's major modules: [Light & Shadow](https://github.com/Terasology/LightAndShadow).

[Proposal](https://github.com/CIS-SoftwareDesign-S21/projects-feedback-section-02-letarte-mw-2pm/issues/13)

# Our Vision

[Light & Shadow](https://github.com/Terasology/LightAndShadow) (or L&S) is a module for the open-source survival game/engine [Terasology](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology) of particular interest to our team. L&S is a competitive, experimental game mode in which players can compete to capture a flag while fighting each other with various weapons. Its dark fantasy/board game pastiche aesthetic is also very intriguing; setting L&S apart from similar multiplayer experiences and other Terasology modules. Our goal is to provide overall improvements to the module by addressing some of the issues and planned improvements present on the [Light & Shadow Github Issues Page](https://github.com/Terasology/LightAndShadow/issues) and the [Light & Shadow pane of the Terasology oranization's Trello board.](https://trello.com/b/QfaZMGMa/the-gameplay-template-to-rule-them-all). 

# Personas

### Reggie, an art teacher

Reggie, 32, teaches art at a middle school in rural New Jersey. He also hosts a board game club for the kids after school. No kids, but he's engaged to his girlfriend of 4 years.  His favorite movies are Donnie Darko and The Nightmare Before Christmas. Reggie's fairly goth but he keeps his appearance pretty neutral during teaching hours. He enjoys playing games on the weekend, mostly single player games, but sometimes he'll pick up a multiplayer game to play with his college friends if there isn't a big startup cost (art teachers get paid next to nothing).

Some of his college friends play Terasology on weekends. Reggie finds survival games kind of intimidating in how complex and opaque they can be, not to mention a big time investment. He prefers games he can play in short bursts. Reggie might be drawn to Light & Shadow because of the way it blends the aesthetic of board games with a dark fantasy vibe. He also might like playing a game he can finish in one sitting, especially if he has some direction on how to play it.

### Mike, a high school student

Mike, a 16 year old high school student from Philadelphia, is an avid survival game player. Ever since he was young, he has always enjoyed playing video games with his friends and finding the next best game that the market has to offer. As a high school student, Mike does not have much money to his name, so he enjoys Terasology as it is free for all players. 

After a brief stretch of playing Terasologyâ€™s core gameplay mode, he is looking to branch out into the world of modules and discovers Light and Shadow. Because he is new to this game mode, he encounters some difficulties in learning as the game does not offer much in terms of direction for newcomers. Mike still wants to learn about Light and Shadow, and he would benefit greatly from some simple, straightforward tutorials in the game that would start him and his friends off on the right foot. 

### Dylan, a college student

Dylan, 20, is a college student from Oregon. Dylan enjoys playing PC games in his spare time, but doesn't necessarily have an advanced tech background. He's a college student looking for a fun, free to play game, but he's unfamiliar with the survival genre and games like Minecraft. For his free time from school on weekends, he's looking into Terasology as a potential game to download.

Terasology has both a singleplayer experience as well as a multiplayer experience to become invested in. As someone who is new to the genre, there is plenty of documentation and in game resoureces to make Terasology beginner friendly, and therefore a great place to start with the entire survival genre. Aside from this, Dylan could also recruit other friends his age with similar backgrounds to play this game online together through the multiplayer experience. Terasology is also being updated quite a bit as time goes on, so there could be new features added to the game that this user is looking for.

### Alex, an online streamer

Alex, age 26, is an online video game streamer in Bensalem, a township in Pennsylvania. He enjoys playing a multitude of video games and has dabbled in many game genres, opting to rotate between different games to play while streaming. He especially enjoys games where he can invite his friends and family to play with, so his favorite genres are those like MOBAs, MMORPGs, and battle royales. Off stream, he enjoys playing board games and competitive trading card games as well.

Having played plenty of hours of Minecraft, Alex figured he would look for something similar that he can enjoy with his family and friends without them having to pay for the game as well. Therefore, he stumbled across Terasology, finding that it is indeed very similar to Minecraft and best of all, it's free. After spending a few hours testing Terasology in the core gameplay mode, he decided to check out some of the many modules that he can activate while playing with others and found the Light and Shadow module. Being the competitive player that he is, this module, which features capture the flag gameplay, gained his attention. As of now, there are still many improvements and fixes needed for the module, but Alex is looking forward to its future development so that he can enjoy it to the fullest with his friends.

# Backlog/Feature List
We reached out to the development community on Discord and one of the Core Team Members niruandaleth suggested we "pick any existing issues or write up issues based on items in the gameplay trello board." Therefore our backlog will be the issues present on both the [Light & Shadow Github Issues Page](https://github.com/Terasology/LightAndShadow/issues) and the [Light & Shadow pane of the Terasology oranization's "The Gameplay Template To Rule Them All" Trello board.](https://trello.com/b/QfaZMGMa/the-gameplay-template-to-rule-them-all).
