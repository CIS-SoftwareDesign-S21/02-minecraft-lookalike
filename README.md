# Our Vision

[Light & Shadow](https://github.com/Terasology/LightAndShadow) (or L&S) is a module for the open-source survival game/engine [Terasology](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology) of particular interest to our team. L&S is a competitive, experimental game mode in which players can compete to capture a flag while fighting each other with various weapons. Its dark fantasy/board game pastiche aesthetic is also very intriguing; setting L&S apart from similar multiplayer experiences and other Terasology modules. Our goal is to provide overall improvements to the module by addressing some of the issues and planned improvenents present on the [Light & Shadow Github Issues Page](https://github.com/Terasology/LightAndShadow/issues) and the [Light & Shadow pane of the Terasology oranization's Trello board.](https://trello.com/b/QfaZMGMa/the-gameplay-template-to-rule-them-all).
