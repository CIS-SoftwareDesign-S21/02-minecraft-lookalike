# Our Vision

[Light & Shadow](https://github.com/Terasology/LightAndShadow) (or L&S) is a module for the open-source survival game/engine [Terasology](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology) of particular interest to our team. L&S is a competitive, experimental game mode in which players can compete to capture a flag while fighting each other with various weapons. Its dark fantasy/board game pastiche aesthetic is also very intriguing; setting L&S apart from similar multiplayer experiences and other Terasology modules. Our goal is to provide overall improvements to the module by addressing some of the issues and planned improvements present on the [Light & Shadow Github Issues Page](https://github.com/Terasology/LightAndShadow/issues) and the [Light & Shadow pane of the Terasology oranization's Trello board.](https://trello.com/b/QfaZMGMa/the-gameplay-template-to-rule-them-all). 

# Personas

## Reggie, an art teacher

Reggie, 32, teaches art at a middle school in rural New Jersey. He also hosts a board game club for the kids after school. No kids, but he's engaged to his girlfriend of 4 years.  His favorite movies are Donnie Darko and The Nightmare Before Christmas. Reggie's fairly goth but he keeps his appearance pretty neutral during teaching hours. He enjoys playing games on the weekend, mostly single player games, but sometimes he'll pick up a multiplayer game to play with his college friends if there isn't a big startup cost (art teachers get paid next to nothing).

Some of his college friends play Terasology on weekends. Reggie finds survival games kind of intimidating in how complex and opaque they can be, not to mention a big time investment. He prefers games he can play in short bursts. Reggie might be drawn to Light & Shadow because of the way it blends the aesthetic of board games with a dark fantasy vibe. He also might like playing a game he can finish in one sitting, especially if he has some direction on how to play it.
